# Electricity-Bill-Calculator
Small project i did while learning C. Maybe good for beginners looking for some examples.

1. Input of name, ID and the unit used of electricity.
2. Differant charges for the amount of units.
3. If the overall bill is over 400 it adds about 11% to the net.

Open for everyone to use.
